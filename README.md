# Unit 3 Challenge: Code Bootstrap Portfolio

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website! I'm thrilled to share my journey as an aspiring front-end developer and showcase the projects and skills that represent my passion for web development. This README file will guide you through the structure of the project and provide information on how to set it up locally.

## Project Overview

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. The website is designed to showcase my skills, projects, and experience as a front-end developer. Feel free to explore the various sections of the website and learn more about me and my work.

In this assignment, I will be building my portfolio layout using the Bootstrap CSS Framework.

Similar in many ways to my previous [challenge from Unit 2](https://github.com/aaron1490/aaron-armstrong-project-portfolio). However, in this version, I am expected to utilise certain boostrap CSS elements and flair!

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- [Bootstrap v5.3.2](https://getbootstrap.com/) 
  - CDN contains CSS and JavaScript Styling

## Project Structure

- [index.html](https://github.com/aaron1490/Bootstrap-Portfolio/blob/main/index.html) - The main HTML file that structures the content fo the portfolio
  - NB this contains some in-line styling for bootstrap elements.
- [style.css](https://github.com/aaron1490/Bootstrap-Portfolio/blob/main/css/style.css) - The style sheet is an add on to further customise bootstrap elements.

## Features

- NavBar:
  - NavBar contains a drop down menu.
  - Entire NavBar gets reduced to a hamburger menu through bootstrap's built in CSS Media Queries.

- Contact Me Section:
  - Text and links within the contact me section light up with a green background colour and box shadow upon hover.

## Before You Begin

* You've learned a ton of material: HTML, CSS, GitHub, GitHub Pages, and Bootstrap. If you feel like you're falling behind, there's no need to panic. You'll have plenty of time to digest and master this material.

* We're diving into JavaScript next unit, and HTML/CSS will start receiving less focus. Still, you'll find that a basic knowledge of HTML/CSS will help you understand JavaScript, especially when we use it to manipulate web pages.

## Commits

* Having an active and healthy commit history on GitHub is important for your future job search. It is also extremely important for making sure your work is saved in your repository. If something breaks, committing often ensures you are able to go back to a working version of your code.

* Committing often is a signal to employers that you are actively working on your code and learning.

  * We use the mantra “commit early and often.”  This means that when you write code that works, add it and commit it!

  * Numerous commits allow you to see how your app is progressing and give you a point to revert to if anything goes wrong.

* Be clear and descriptive in your commit messaging.

  * When writing a commit message, avoid vague messages like "fixed." Be descriptive so that you and anyone else looking at your repository knows what happened with each commit.

* We would like you to have well over 200 commits by graduation, so commit early and often!

## Instructions

1. Create a new GitHub repositories and name it `Bootstrap-Portfolio`.

2. Clone this repository to your computer.

3. Inside your `Bootstrap-Portfolio` repo, create the folder structure for the webpage.

4. Using Bootstrap, recreate your portfolio site with the following items:

   The website should include the following bootstrap components:

    - A Navigation bar
    
    - A navigation menu at the top. Feel free to use the navbar code provided in Bootstrap's documentation, or create your own navbar by applying the correct Bootstrap classes to your HTML.

      - Include links that are applicable to your portfolio.
  
        - Links should navigate to the appropriate sections 

    - A hero section

        - A jumbotron featuring your picture, your name, and any other information you'd like to include.

    - A work section

      - A section displaying your work in grid. 

        - If you need to use placeholder image use: https://placehold.co/ 

      - Use bootstrap cards for each project.

        - The description should give a brief overview of the work.

      - Each project will eventually link to your class project work!

    - A skills section

      - List out the skills you expect to learn from the bootcamp.

    - An about / contact section.

      - An "About Me" section in the same row.
    
    - A footer section.

      - All hyperlinks should have a hover effect.
